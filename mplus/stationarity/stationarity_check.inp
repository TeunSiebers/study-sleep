TITLE:          
Daytime, pre-bedtime, and post-bedtime smarphone use on sleep quality;
Twolevel fixed effects model to check for stationarity;

DATA:           
FILE = 'phone.dat';

VARIABLE:       
NAMES = id day daytime prebed postbed sleep;    
USEVARIABLES =  day sleep;
CLUSTER = id; !The Between-Level ID variable; 

ANALYSIS:       
TYPE = twolevel; !Two-Level Model with paths that are latent variables
ESTIMATOR = BAYES; !Lagged variables can only be estimated with Bayes in Mplus
BITERATIONS = (5000); !Run at least 5,000 iterations of the MCMC algorithm
PROCESSORS = 4; !Use 4 processors to increase the computational speed
THIN = 2; !Set the thinning factor to 2 to increase stable estimations

MODEL:          
%within%                   
    sleep ON day;
    sleep;

%between%                   
    [sleep]; !mean intercept sleep quality

    sleep; !intercept variance sleep quality

OUTPUT:

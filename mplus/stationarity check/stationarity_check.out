  TITLE:
  Fragmented, and sticky smartphone use on distraction and task delay;
  Twolevel Fixed Effects Model to Check for Stationarity

  DATA:
  FILE = 'mplus_stationarity.dat';

  VARIABLE:
  NAMES = id survey distract tdelay time fragment sticky day;
  USEVARIABLES =  day distract tdelay;
  CLUSTER = id; !The Between-Level ID variable;

  ANALYSIS:
  TYPE = twolevel; !Two-Level Model with paths that are latent variables
  ESTIMATOR = BAYES; !Lagged variables can only be estimated with Bayes in Mplus
  BITERATIONS = (5000); !Run at least 5,000 iterations of the MCMC algorithm
  PROCESSORS = 4; !Use 4 processors to increase the computational speed
  THIN = 2; !Set the thinning factor to 2 to increase stable estimations

  MODEL:
  %within%
      distract ON day;
      tdelay ON day;
      distract;
      tdelay;

  %between%
      [distract]; !mean intercept distraction
      [tdelay]; !mean intercept tdelay

      distract; !intercept variance distraction
      tdelay; !intercept variance tdelay

      [day];

  OUTPUT:
  standardized tech8;

TITLE:          
Fragmented, and sticky smartphone use on distraction and task delay;
Twolevel Fixed Effects Model to Check for Stationarity

VARIABLE:       
NAMES = id survey distract tdelay time fragment sticky day;    
USEVARIABLES =  day distract tdelay;

ANALYSIS:       
TYPE = twolevel; !Two-Level Model with paths that are latent variables
ESTIMATOR = BAYES; !Lagged variables can only be estimated with Bayes in Mplus
BITERATIONS = (5000); !Run at least 5,000 iterations of the MCMC algorithm
PROCESSORS = 4; !Use 4 processors to increase the computational speed
THIN = 2; !Set the thinning factor to 2 to increase stable estimations
